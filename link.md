# Connecting to Cloud SQL - MySQL

## Before you begin

1. If you haven't already, set up a Java Development Environment (including google-cloud-sdk and
maven utilities) by following the [java setup guide](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup) and
[create a project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).

1. Create a 2nd Gen Cloud SQL Instance by following these
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-instance). Note the connection string,
database user, and database password that you create.

1. Create a database for your application by following these
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-databases). Note the database
name.

1. Create a service account with the 'Cloud SQL Client' permissions by following these
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-external-app#4_if_required_by_your_authentication_method_create_a_service_account).
Download a JSON key to use to authenticate your connection.

1. Use the information noted in the previous steps:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/neil/Downloads/pac12-database-270119-9eda3428b194.json
export CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME=pac12-database-270119:us-central1:pac12-sql
export DB_USER=root
export DB_PASS=yozq7oGaO88s4lLD
export DB_NAME=pac12
```
Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more
secure solution such as [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/) to help keep secrets safe.

## Deploying locally

To run this application locally, run the following command inside the project folder:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
```

Navigate towards `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to verify your application is running correctly.

## Google App Engine Standard

To run on GAE-Standard, create an AppEngine project by following the setup for these
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/quickstart#before-you-begin)
and verify that
[appengine-maven-plugin](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#optional_install_maven_or_gradle_plugin_for_app_engine)
 has been added in your build section as a plugin.


### Development Server

The following command will run the application locally in the the GAE-development server:
```bash
mvn appengine:run
```

### Deploy to Google Cloud

First, update `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml` with the correct values to pass the
environment variables into the runtime.

Next, the following command will deploy the application to your Google Cloud project:
```bash
mvn appengine:deploy
```

### Deploy to Cloud Run

See the [Cloud Run documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connect-cloudsql)
for more details on connecting a Cloud Run service to Cloud SQL.

1. Build the container image:

  ```sh
  gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/run-mysql
  ```

2. Deploy the service to Cloud Run:

  ```sh
  gcloud run deploy run-mysql --image gcr.io/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/run-mysql
  ```

  Take note of the URL output at the end of the deployment process.

3. Configure the service for use with Cloud Run

  ```sh
  gcloud run services update run-mysql \
      --add-cloudsql-instances [INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME] \
      --set-env-vars CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME=[INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME],\
        DB_USER=[MY_DB_USER],DB_PASS=[MY_DB_PASS],DB_NAME=[MY_DB]
  ```
  Replace environment variables with the correct values for your Cloud SQL
  instance configuration.

  This step can be done as part of deployment but is separated for clarity.

4. Navigate your browser to the URL noted in step 2.
